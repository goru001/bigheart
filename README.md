# HereToCare (www.heretocare.in)

This is a repository for the Web Platform that has been built to bring a positive change in society. 

HereToCare aims at bringing people together to share what they have, and seek what they need. HereToCare is a result of the realisation that there are people around us who dearly need "something", also, there is someone who is in abundance of that "something", We aim to connect those two kinds of people together for all possible kinds of "something". 

#####bigheart(i.e this repository)  
bigheart consists of the high-level yet technical description of HereToCare.

ZeroLevelDFD and the FirstLevelDFD explain the gist of all the processes involved, starting from a user initiating help, to the help reaching the needy.
